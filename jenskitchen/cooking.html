<center><h1>Cooking with Daniel</h1></center>

<p> This is from the time we had Daniel Radcliff in our kitchen!</p>

<p>When I first invited Daniel to stop by, I wasn't told he was going to bring all his dogs with him. Thats right. All 28 dogs were introducted to my kitchen that day as well. But, those dogs weren't in crates or even on leashes, those dogs were set free to roam and run as much as they wanted. Daniel also brought so much dog food and those dogs were <em>hungry!</em> 

<center><h2>Six-hour Salad</h2>

<p>Daniel prepared a salad of arugula, smoked tomatoes, tomato jam, and grilled avocado (it's as good as it sounds!). I jokingly called it "6-hour Salad" because that's how long he worked on it. The fresh tomatoes were slowly smoked over woodchips in the grill, and when they were softened, Daniel separated out the seeds which he reduced into a smoky jam. The tomatoes were cut into strips to put on the salads. As the day meandered, the avocados finally went on the grill after dark. I was on flashlight duty while Daniel checked for the perfect grill marks.</p>

<p>I wrote up a streamlined adaptation of his recipe that requires <em>much</em> less time and serves 6 people instead of <em>five</em>times that amount.</p>

<h2>The Main Course</h2></center>

<p>In addition to the smoky grilled salad, Daniel served tarragon cornish hens with a cognac cream sauce loaded with chanterelles and grapes, and wild rice with grilled ramps (wild garlicky leeks). Dinner was served close to midnight, but it was a party so nobody cared.</p>

<p>We left that night (technically, early the next morning) with full bellies, new cooking tips, and nearly 5 hours of footage. I'm considering renaming the show "Cooking for dogs". </p>
